# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Movie Recommendation System** created as a practice project to strengthen Machine Learning concepts.  
The system recommends movies similar to a user’s input using the **Cosine Similarity Algorithm**.  

It is implemented in **Google Colab** using a **CSV dataset** containing movie details such as title, genres, overview, and keywords.
